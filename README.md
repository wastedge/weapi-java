# Wastedge API for Java

The Wastedge API for Java library implements the Wastedge API for Java.

For more information on the Wastedge API, see the documentation in the [Wastedge REST API](https://github.com/wastedge/weapi) wiki.

## Projects

The Wastedge API for Java contains a few different projects:

* `wastedge-api`: Provides an implementation of the Wastedge REST API;
* `wastedge-api-jdbc`: Provides a basic JDBC implementation to work with the Wastedge REST API. Part of this is a query language that allows you to perform queries using JDBC;
* `wastedge-api-jdbc-maven-plugin`: A support Maven plugin for the `wastedge-api-jdbc` library for code generation;
* `wastedge-api-jasper-designer`: A plugin for iReports Designer to connect directly to the Wastedge API from inside iReports Designer.

At the moment we only support iReports Designer. Support for iReports Studio is being developed.
